# Standardization

Scaling data around 0, and get std deviation b/w -1 to 1
Numerical Standardization

var standardized 'data' = (
    data' - Average) / Std Deviation

- Average = mean
- Std Deviation = 
  - sqrt of variance
  - A measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or   dispersion of a set of data values.

- Variance - expectations of squred deviations


## When to use
Distribution of data is not normalized i.e not evently distributed.
It will accoount for some super off values (i.e. large or too small)
